This is dangerous as you are able to delete / (root) if you have privileges and destroys your machine. Targets includes files and folders and can contain relative or absolute paths.</td>

                <td>There are 2 basic ways to use grep, to pipe the command into grep, or let grep have direct access to file. For example, you can do a direct access, like grep eth0 /var/log/syslog, or a pipe like dmesg | grep eth0. A pipe is this |, and this allows the piping of data to another application.</td>

                <td>chmod {attributes} {file}</td>
                <td>chmod allows you to change the attributes of a file.</td>
                <td>There are 2 main ways to change these for users, for example +x to add the execute bit, -w to remove the writable bit. There is also a numerical method, where each group has its bit, and you add the numbers together. For example, 4 is read, 2 is write and execute. So, using numerical, if I want to make a file +rwx, it will be chmod 777.</td>
